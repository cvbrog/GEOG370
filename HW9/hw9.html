<h1>Homework 9: NC Farmer's Market Data 2018 </h1>
<h2>Caroline Brogden</h2>
<h3>Explanation of map here. To remember: I used natural breaks (jenks) to classify the data, because it follows the data's natural distribution. And why this topic? </h3>

<h3>After toggling through different classification options and deciding to use natural breaks, the choropleth still missed some of the nuance in the data. To add context, the total count of farmer's markets are labeled in the following map. Consequent interpretation addresses how counties where all the farmer's markets accept SNAP may have only one or two total farmer's markets. </h3>
